# DataCamp
DataCamp is great platform to learn and master data science.
Here All the courses that I have completed. 
All the texts from DataCamp, and the codes also, but with some modifications by Me because Some of these are set up to actually run locally (mapped to the datasets)  
<p>In the video, you learned how to choose a good number of clusters for a dataset using the k-means inertia graph.  You are given an array <code>samples</code> containing the measurements (such as area, perimeter, length, and several others) of samples of grain.  What&apos;s a good number of clusters in this case?</p>
<p><code>KMeans</code> and PyPlot (<code>plt</code>) have already been imported for you.</p>
<p>This dataset was sourced from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
