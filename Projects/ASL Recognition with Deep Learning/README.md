<h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.</p>

<p>In this project, you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters.  After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network and test its performance.</p>

<p>The recommended prerequisites for this project are <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python">Deep Learning in Python</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing">Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing</a>.</p>
