<h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, you will build a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation. You will use <a href="https://keras.io/">keras</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html">scikit-learn</a>, <a href="http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/">scikit-image</a>, and <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.2/reference/">numpy</a>, among other popular Python libraries.</p>

<p>This project is the third part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.</p>
