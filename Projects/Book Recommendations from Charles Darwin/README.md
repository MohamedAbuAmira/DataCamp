<h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>Recommendation systems are at the heart of many products such as Netflix or Amazon. They generally rely on metadata (e.g., the actors or director of a movie) or on user tastes (e.g., the movies you liked before) to determine which you are most likely to enjoy. 
But when you are working with text-heavy datasets, you have access to a much richer resourceâ€”the whole text! In this project, you will learn how to build the basis of a book recommendation system based on their content. You will use Charles Darwin's bibliography to find out which books might interest you.</p>

<p>To complete this project, you should be familiar with the basics of Python, Pandas and Natural Language Processing. <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations">pandas Foundations</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/natural-language-processing-fundamentals-in-python">Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python</a> are recommended as prerequisites.</p>

<p>The dataset was manually collected from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>.</p>
