<h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password. 
But what makes a good password? 
In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
published <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html">publication 800-63B</a> 
titled <em>Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management</em>. 
This publication doesn't tell you what is a <em>good</em> password,
but it does have specific rules for what is a <em>bad</em> password.</p>

<p>In this project, you will take a list of user passwords and, 
using publication 800-63B, you will write code that automatically 
detects and flags the bad passwords.</p>

<p>To complete this project, you need to know how to manipulate strings in
pandas DataFrames and be familiar with regular expressions.
Before starting this project we recommend that you have completed the following courses:</p>
