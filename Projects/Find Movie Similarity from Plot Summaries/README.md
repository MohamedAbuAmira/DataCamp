<h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an exciting field of study for data scientists where they develop algorithms that can make sense out of conversational language used by humans. In this Project, you will use NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia.</p>

<p>This Project lets you apply the skills from <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/natural-language-processing-fundamentals-in-python">Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python/">Unsupervised Learning in Python</a>. We recommend that you are familiar with the content in those courses before starting this Project.  </p>

<p>The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a> as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.</p>
