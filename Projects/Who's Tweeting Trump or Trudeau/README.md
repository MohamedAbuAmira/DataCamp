# Project Description
<p> Now that you've completed Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python, let's get started with applying our knowledge of text to a new domain: Twitter. Tweets are notoriously difficult, as they are shorter than most texts and usually have hard-to-parse content like hashtags, mentions, links and emoji.

Despite the difficulties, tweets are fun content, so in this notebook we'll take a look at classifying two prominent North American politicians. Can we determine if it is Donald Trump or Justin Trudeau based on just a tweet? Let's see!</p>
