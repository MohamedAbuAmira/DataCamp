    "### Course Description\n",
    "Do you know the basics of supervised learning and want to use state-of-the-art models on real-world datasets? Gradient boosting is currently one of the most popular techniques for efficient modeling of tabular datasets of all sizes. XGboost is a very fast, scalable implementation of gradient boosting, with models using XGBoost regularly winning online data science competitions and being used at scale across different industries. In this course, you'll learn how to use this powerful library alongside pandas and scikit-learn to build and tune supervised learning models. You'll work with real-world datasets to solve classification and regression problems."

    "# 1- Classification with XGBoost\n",
    "This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental idea behind XGBoostâ€”boosted learners. Once you understand how XGBoost works, you'll apply it to solve a common classification problem found in industry: predicting whether a customer will stop being a customer at some point in the future.\n",

    "After a brief review of supervised regression, you'll apply XGBoost to the regression task of predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa. You'll learn about the two kinds of base learners that XGboost can use as its weak learners, and review how to evaluate the quality of your regression models."
